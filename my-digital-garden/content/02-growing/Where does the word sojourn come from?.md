The word tộšāb is the Hebrew word for "sojourner", and it has a root word yšb which means "from legal institutions", thereby describing a person's legal status. Another Hebrew word that means "sojourner" is gēr, meaning "a person (or group) is residing, either temporarily or permanently, in a community and place that is not primarily their own and is dependent on the “good-will” of that community for their continued existence."

Biblical characters who sojourned:
Abraham sojourned in Egypt (Genesis 12:10) and Gerar (Genesis 20:1); Joseph and his brothers sojourned in Egypt (Genesis 47:4); and a Levite sojourned in Judah and Ephraim (Judges 17:7–9; 19:1). On other occasions the whole of Israel is seen as sojourning in Egypt (Isaiah 52:4) or Babylon (Ezra 1:2–4). And frequently individuals are said to sojourn within ancient Israel (Leviticus 22:17–18; Isaiah 16:4).

The mandate to treat the sojourner well: Deuteronomy 10:17–18
17 For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe. 18 He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing. 19 Love the sojourner, therefore, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
