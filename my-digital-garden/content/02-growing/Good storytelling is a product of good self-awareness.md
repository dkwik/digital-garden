# Good storytelling is a product of good self-awareness

How do you know if someone has very high self-awareness? For me, I notice that the best storytellers are typically highly self-aware people. This is because our sense of identity is framed by the stories we tell, and come to believe, about ourselves.

Good stories = high sense of self-identity = good self-awareness.

When I speak of good storytelling, I don't mean the funny-but-shallow "butt-joke at the dinner table" type of stories, nor those experiential-but-inconsequential "Drinking pi√±a coladas on a Puerto Rico beach changed my life" type of stories. Instead, I'm referring to meaningful life stories that narrates the depths of one's being, like one's from [The Moth](https://themoth.org/).

Here's why people who can tell these stories are necessarily self-aware. To be able to tell this story you need to be conscientious on a number of things:
1. Who you were before a 5 second moment.
2. What happened during that incident
3. How those things ellicited an emotional response from you
5. How you have changed as a result of that
6.
