# Sabbath is a gift, but it takes 'sacrifice'
Sabbath is a gift, but to redeem it, it might take sacrifice. My impulses don't want me to stop doing things, so I must learn to sacrifice my need for control. Culture glorifies overworking by sticking on the label 'grit'. I admire gritty people that are truly 'hope-driven' - too often I use 'grit' to mask an incessant need for control (i'm working on it). Can I say that tomorrow's work will take care of itself, and allow myself to truly receive the gift of rest? 

Here's a litmus test: If I take a day off for complete rest, do I catch myself dreaming about my side-projects, or thinking "when will my Sabbath be over so that I can do X?" If so, I might be missing the point. 

And this is no new issue. Check out what Amos has to say:

"*Hear this, you who trample the needy and do away with the poor of the land, saying, “When will the New Moon be over that we may sell grain, and the Sabbath be ended that we may market wheat?” — skimping the measure, boosting the price and cheating with dishonest scales, 6 buying the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, selling even the sweepings with the wheat.*" Amos 8:4-6

Ouch, that's me if i'm not careful.
