# There can be sacredness in dull, everyday moments.
What if dull, everyday moments matter? I'm referring to moments as mundane as making your bed in the morning, spreading some peanut butter over freshly toasted bread, or waiting in line at the grocery store?

We live in a society that sees these tasks as 'obstacles' to getting the real stuff done.  Chores, feeding our body, and waiting in line are always an obstacle in the way of more productive work, and rarely make it the subject of our full attention.

This can lead to perpetual dissatisfaction, because these habits make up a significant portion of our day. Are we to simply be dissatisfied during this big chunk of time, constantly rushing to be done with these embodied human experiences for the sake of 'higher-impact work'?
