# Immigrants "grease the wheels" of the US economy

Immigrants fill the holes in the labor market by flowing into pockets that aren't being filled by local talent. This helps the US labor market relieve the bottlenecks that slow down growth.

This is done in a number of ways:

# Geographically

 Internal geographic mobility within the US has been on the decline, resulting in the slowing of regional economic convergence. In other words, the areas that need labor are struggling more to get it, because less people are willing to relocate to those locations. (Moretti, Enrico. 2012)

Foreign-born populations on the other hand helps to alleviate this as they are more responsive to economic conditions and have a far higher rate of mobility, especially within the first 10 years of their career (Basso & Peri, 2020). Immigrants are no stranger to moving, and they may be the talent you need to fill labor shortages.

88% of our global talent pool are willing to move anywhere in the US.

# Specialty Occupations

The U.S has long faced a labor shortage in highly specialized fields, and this is especially true in tech, despite news of recent layoffs. The US Bureau of Labor and Statistics forecasts that computer science STEM occupations will grow 15% by 2029, vs. 3.7% for non-STEM jobs, 

Immigrants fuel key specialty occupations that are lacking in the U.S labor market. Here are some statistics that describe the extent of this gap.

	-40% of computer software developers are immigrants.
	-One fourth of all STEM workers in the US are foreign born
	 -44% of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants / children of immigraqnts
	-44% of medical scientists are foreign born

Employers looking to fill tech roles but who aren't open to sponsoring visas are missing out on a significant portion of the talent pool for tech. While legal complexities can be mystifying for employers, bringing in a recruiting partner experienced in filling foreign national talent can help.

Additionally, if you are a university or non-profit research organization, your visa-friendly status  allows you to bypass the visa lottery system that every other U.S employer needs to go through to access global talent, providing stability and security in the retention process.

# Accessing the hidden global talent pool

Finding the right candidate for an open role can be challenging, but working with a specialized recruiting partner can help. Sojon's pool of 8000+ candidates might be the right network you need to find the perfect candidate for your tech position.
