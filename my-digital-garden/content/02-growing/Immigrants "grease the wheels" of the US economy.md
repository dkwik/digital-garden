# Immigrants "grease the wheels" of the US economy

Immigrants fill the holes in the labor market by flowing into pockets that aren't being filled by local talent. This helps the US labor market relieve the bottlenecks that slow down growth.

This is done in a number of ways:

# Geographically

 Internal geographic mobility within the US has been on the decline, resulting in the slowing of regional economic convergence. In other words, the areas that need labor are struggling more to get it, because less people are willing to relocate to those locations. (Moretti, Enrico. 2012)

Foreign born population on the other hand helps to alleviate this as they are more responsive to economic conditions and have a far higher rate of mobility, especially within the first 10 years of their career (Basso & Peri, 2020). 

# Specialty Occupations

Immigrants fuel key specialty occupations that are lacking in the U.S labor market.

	-42% of computer software developers.

Drawbacks
Government needs to be careful about lowering wages of competing workers
