A growing belief seems to be that truth is relative (postmodernism). You can have your truth, and I can have mine, and none are wrong. It can stem from a sincere desire to be sensitive towards differing beliefs, or it can be a combative way to dismiss organized religion - the claim that all religions are true, and there is no one true religion.

Unfortunately, there are some flaws with this line of thinking.

 If you believe that there is no absolute truth, and views of truth-relativity are right, then you are guilty of the very thing you say, for that in itself is a claim of exclusivity.

Here are more (hopefully obvious) examples:

- There is no truth. Is that a true statement?
- We can't know truth. Is that a truth you know?
- There are no absolutes. Is this an absolute?
- All truth are relative. Is this also relative?
- Talking about God is meaningless. What does this statement about God mean?
- You can only know truth through experience. What experience taught you that truth?
- Never take anyone's advice on that issue. Should I take your advice on that?
- No one can know any truth about religion. How did you come to know this truth about religion?
- I don't believe anything as true unless it can be proven scientifically. What scientific experiment taught you that truth?
- You can't know anything for sure. Are you sure about that?

The truth is, everybody makes truth claims. Yes, I indeed just made a truth claim about truth claims.

It's as small as saying that pineapple should not go on pizza, and as big as saying that it is more probable that there is an intelligent creator than not.

That being said, while I believe postmodern beliefs are flawed, I am empathetic to the spirit of pluralism, such as the posture of Isaiah Berlin when he writes:

"Let us have the courage of our admitted ignorance, of our doubts and uncertainties. At least we can try to discover what others […] require, by […] making it possible for ourselves to know men as they truly are, by listening to them carefully and sympathetically, and understanding them and their lives and their needs, one by one individually."
