# All aspects of a business has the potential to have a redeeming quality

When thinking about how [[there is such a thing as good business]], I tend to think about social enterprises, or big philanthropic acts, or top commitment to environmental stewardship. But it seems to me that the potential for good business can be more holistic than single acts of altruism.

	- Brand
	- Culture
	- Business Model
	- Partnerships
	- Ambition
