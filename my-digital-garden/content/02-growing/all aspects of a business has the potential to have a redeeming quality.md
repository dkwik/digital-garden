# All aspects of a business has the potential to have a redeeming quality

When thinking about how [[there is such a thing as good business]], most of the time, we think about social enterprises, or big philanthropic acts. But I think the potential for business goes far deeper.

It starts with understanding the influence it has on society. Business doesn't work in a vacuum, it creates culture. 


Done right, all aspects of a business can have redemptive qualities
	- Products
	- Brand
	- Culture
	- Business Model
	- Partnerships
	- Ambition
