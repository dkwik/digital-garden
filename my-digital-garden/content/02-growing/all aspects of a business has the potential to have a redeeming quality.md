# All aspects of a business has the potential to have a redeeming quality

When thinking about how [[there is such a thing as good business]], I tend to think about social enterprises, or big philanthropic acts, or top commitment to environmental stewardship. But it seems to me that the potential for good business can be more holistic than single acts of altruism.

Done right, all aspects of a business can have redemptive qualities:
	- Products
	- Brand
	- Culture
	- Business Model
	- Partnerships
	- Ambition

## Products
Products should be fashioned with human-design, not just strategic exploitation.

Brands should advance virtuous narratives of the authentic human experience, not by the concealment or manipulation of truth.
