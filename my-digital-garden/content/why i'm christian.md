I wish that Christianity had a better reputation in the world today. Some may view Christianity as an ancient form of escapism that is now obsolete post-enlightenment, while tolerating it's continued presence as long as it's kept private. And when they see the Christian mission, they may think of a military conquest, or the colonization of indigenous people groups. The word mission is full of baggage. But aren't we all 'on mission'? Don't we all recognize that the world is broken? and are finding our place to 'make it a better place'? Don't we all bear the responsibility of evangelizing what we believe to be good, right, and proper for human flourishing?
