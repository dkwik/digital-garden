Deuteronomy 10
-When Moses was about to die he reiterates God's laws to Israel as a way to remind them how God wants them to live. "The Lord executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing." "Love the sojourner therefore, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt".

For most people, immigration is a policy issue, rather than a personal issue. It does not easily resonate.
