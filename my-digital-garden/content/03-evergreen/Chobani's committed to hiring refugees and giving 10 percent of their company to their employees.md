## Chobani's committed to hiring refugees and giving 10 percent of their company to their employees

Founded in 2005, Chobani is an American yogurt brand that holds 20% of the U.S  yogurt market. It's founder, Hamdi Ulukaya growing up in a sheep farm with strong values, believed that that capitalism and humanitarianism feed off each other. He started hiring a few refugees in his early days in his community. Today, over 30% of Chobani's 2000+ employees are refugees.

They have a minimum wage of $20/hour, provide a $1200 annual childcare stipend, created ESL classes to refugees, and many more. The result?
