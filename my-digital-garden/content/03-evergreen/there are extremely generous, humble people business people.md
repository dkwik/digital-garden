# there are extremely generous, humble people in business 

A few years ago, I got to meet an amazing man at an entrepreneurship conference. His name is Tom Hsieh.

What's so special about him? Tom Hsieh is an executive who has chosen to live on about $45,000/year to support him, his wife and his daughter, despite having access to more than $200,000/year. Think that's radical? He helped take a company public, founded 2 companies, and has been the president/CEO of 5 airline and aerospace companies. He lives below the national median household income, and lived in the 2nd poorest community in LA. When I met him, he exuded [[idealistic pragmatism]], kindness and a deep aura of humble authority. Not everyone in business is in it for the money.
