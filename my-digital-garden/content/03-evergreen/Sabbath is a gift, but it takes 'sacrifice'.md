# Sabbath is a gift, but it takes 'sacrifice'
Sabbath is a gift, but to redeem it, it might take sacrifice. Our impulses don't want us to stop doing things, so we must learn to sacrifice our need for control. Today's culture glorifies overworking by sticking on the label 'grit'. Some people that look gritty are truly 'hope-driven', while others use 'grit' to mask their incessant need for control (i'll raise my hand first on this one). Can I say that tomorrow's work will take care of itself, and allow myself to truly receive the gift of rest? 

Here's a litmus test: If I take a day off for complete rest, do I catch myself dreaming about my side-projects, or thinking "when will my Sabbath be over so that I can do X?" If so, I might be missing the point. 

"*Hear this, you who trample the needy and do away with the poor of the land, saying, “When will the New Moon be over that we may sell grain, and the Sabbath be ended that we may market wheat?” — skimping the measure, boosting the price and cheating with dishonest scales, 6 buying the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, selling even the sweepings with the wheat.*" Amos 8:4-6

Sounds familiar? Ouch, that's me if i'm not careful.
