# There is such a thing as 'good' business

What comes to mind when you picture a business? Profit machines exploiting the vulnerable? Pompous people in pretty suits? Yeah, me too sometimes. Business doesn't typically come off as the most altruistic profession, but I believe it has the potential to be.

In fact, I already believe [[there are extremely generous, humble people business people]], and some of [[Some of the toughest social issues are best solved through business]]. And there's a particular subset of businesses that I think are [incredibly special] (more on that later)

You hear of the famous greats of the 'good business' movement and how they have done some counter-cultural things in pursuit of good business, such as how [[Chobani's committed to hiring refugees and giving 10 percent of their company to their employees]], or when [[Patagonia told it's customers not to buy their jackets]], or how [[Ecosia donates 80% of its profits to reforestation, planting over 180 million trees]]. 

And there's a certain breed of business whose existence is entirely to serve a social end - the social enterprise.
