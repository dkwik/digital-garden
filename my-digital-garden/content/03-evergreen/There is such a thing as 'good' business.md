# There is such a thing as 'good' business

What comes to mind when you picture a business? Profit machines exploiting the vulnerable? Pompous people in pretty suits? Yeah, me too sometimes. Business doesn't typically come off as the most altruistic profession, but I believe it has the potential to be.

In fact, I already believe that [[there are extremely generous, humble people business people]], and that [[some of the toughest social issues might be best solved through business]]. And there's a particular subset of businesses that I think are incredibly special (more on that next time)

Of course, there are the famous great stories of the 'good business' movement and how they have done some counter-cultural things, such as how [[Chobani's committed to hiring refugees and giving 10 percent of their company to their employees]], or when [[Patagonia told it's customers not to buy their jackets]], or how [[Ecosia donates 80% of its profits to reforestation, planting over 180 million trees]]. And of course there is the social enterprise - a certain breed of business whose existence is entirely to serve a social end ([[social enterprises provides spare change for social change]]).

But good business doesn't only have to be explicitly humanitarian (though some of the best are). I believe this because [[all aspects of a business has the potential to have a redeeming quality]]
