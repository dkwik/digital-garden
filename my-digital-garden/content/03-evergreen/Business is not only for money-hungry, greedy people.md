# Is business only for power-hungry, money-minded people?

What comes to mind when you picture a business? Profit machines exploiting the vulnerable? Pompous people in pretty suits? Yeah I get it, business doesn't typically come off as the most altruistic profession, but I believe it has the potential to be.

In fact, I already believe [[there are extremely generous, humble people business people]], and some of [[Some of the toughest social issues are best solved through business]]. And there's a particular subset of businesses that I think are [incredible special] (more on that later)

You hear of the famous greats of the 'good business' movement and how they have done some counter-cultural things in pursuit of good business, such as how [[Chobani's committed to hiring refugees and giving 10 percent of their company to their employees]], or when [Patagonia told it's customers not to buy their jackets], or how [Ecosia donated 80% of its profits to reforestation, planting over 120 million trees]. 

Granted these are huge corporations with tons of resources. But what happens in small business [that are credited for 63% of jobs from 1995 to 2021](https://www.uschamber.com/small-business/state-of-small-business-now)? 

And there's a certain breed of business that I've not even started on who  social enterprises and poverty alleviation through microlending.
