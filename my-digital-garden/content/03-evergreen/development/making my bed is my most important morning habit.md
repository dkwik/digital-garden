# Making my bed is my most important morning habit

Making my bed every morning is extremely annoying. 

It is done over and over again each morning, only for it to be 'unmade' a few hours later. 
Why bother doing it then? 

Besides the strange phenomena that a decluttered room seems to declutter my mind, this unproductive, boring, brainless habit seems to create in me a type of patience that carries with me through the day.

It forces my brain to slow down. It allows my body to catch up with a racing mind. 

Isn't it interesting how our minds can start 'racing' within seconds of waking? Perhaps this happens because we've been habitually conditioned into instant gratification & stimulation through our technological tools. ([[digital caffeine is a real, serious drug]])

That's why as I make boring fold after boring fold, morning after morning, I remind myself that these boring moments matter.

Yes it boosts my mental health, yes it makes me more productive, but most significantly, it creates good rhythms conducive for a life of faith ([[there can be sacredness in dull, monotonous habits]]).
