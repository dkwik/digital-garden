# There can be sacredness in dull, monotonous habits

What if dull, everyday moments matter? I'm referring to habits as mundane as making your bed in the morning ([[making my bed is my most important morning habit]]), spreading some peanut butter over freshly toasted bread, or waiting in line at the grocery store.

We live in a society that sees these tasks as 'obstacles' to getting the real stuff done. For example, I think that cleaning my room is a necessary evils that I begrudgingly get through, I wonder why my body is so needy that I need to feed it 3 times a day. I tap my feet as I wait in line at the grocery store because 'there's something more important to get to'. These dull monotonous habits are usually seen merely as an obstacle in the way of more productive work. Rarely do I make them the subject of my full attention. 

But there's something that seems to be wrong about that.

These habits make up a significant portion of my day. Am I to simply be perpetually dissatisfied during this sizable chunk of my week, constantly rushing to be done with these embodied human experiences for the sake of 'higher-impact work'?

Or can these ordinary moments teach me something about patience, gratitude, and being an embodied creature?
