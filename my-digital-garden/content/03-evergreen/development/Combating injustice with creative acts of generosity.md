What should we do at the face of injustice? I'm compelled by Jesus' vision for resistance against injustice - it is neither passive nor vengeful, but instead, creatively resistive.

In his Sermon on the Mount he provides a radical vision for how with certain situations, there might be opportunity to respond to harm & evil in a unique way:

*"You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well."* *Matthew 5:38-40*

Now this might sound like just being a doormat, but it is in actuality, deceptively resistive upon closer look:

-Offering your left cheek was an active move to restore honor without reciprocating violence. 
	The initial slap on the right cheek implies a backhand slap, which in Jesus' context was a severe 'hit' to someone's dignity. Striking with the back of the hand was done to those with lower status, while striking with the palm was done against equals. Offering the other cheek (requiring an open palm) was thus an active rejection of the status conferred onto the victim by the aggressor, polarizing the aggressor to treat them as an equal.
	
-Giving your coat to a greedy person
	Hebrew law allowed offering your coat as collateral, but asking for an inner shirt was exceedingly greedy. Responding to someone's greed by offering your coat also puts one in a very vulnerable position. This polarizing act generosity forces the opponent to confront their act. (This seems like a similar tactic to philosopher Diogenes' extreme public acts of defiance)

-Going the extra mile
	Roman soldiers could force someone to carry loads for them for up to a Roman mile (1000 paces), reducing someone a pawn of labor. Choosing not to passively submit, but willingly go the extra mile shifts the relationship to one of active generosity.

Why do this when combative vindication feels more natural? Perhaps Jesus wanted to show that "an eye for an eye" only perpetuates cycles of violence. Creative acts of resistance marked by radical generosity & sacrifice can send a potent message.
