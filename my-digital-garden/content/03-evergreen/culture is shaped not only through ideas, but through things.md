# culture is created not only through ideas, but through things

How does culture accrete from a micro-level (the ambitious idea of one person) to come to define society at a broader scale (the collective acceptance of entire nations)?

I tend to first think of ideas and their chief evangelists. John Locke with the Enlightenment, Martin Luther King Jr with the Civil Rights Movement, and the list goes on. But what about materialism, instant gratification, and multiculturalism? These all do not have any one founder (hardly anyone believes materialism is good), and yet why do they still exist?

It seems that the creation of culture cannot be explained through ideas alone, because it is also created through *things*. Materialism, instant gratification, and multiculturalism exists in large part because of the creation of *things* like, shopping malls, social media, and the airplane.

The discipline of sociology agrees with this. Sociologists categorize culture into immaterial culture (ideas) and material culture (things). Immaterial culture are the 'values we hold', while material culture are the 'things we create'. But don't the things we create come first from our ideals? For example, don't we create political parties *because* we believe in democracy?

Yes, but it also moves the other way, that is, as we shape things, they in turn shape us. For example, we might have created social networks because we believed that globalization is good, but social networks have in turn shaped us by forcing us to curate online identities. 

This makes a case for the need to be hyper aware of not only our cultural 'ideas', but also our cultural 'things', whose formational power I would argue are much stronger.
