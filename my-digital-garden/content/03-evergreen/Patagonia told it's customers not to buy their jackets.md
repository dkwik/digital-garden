# Patagonia told it's customers not to buy their jackets

In 2011, Patagonia launched a "Don't Buy This Jacket" campaign that launched on Black Friday, telling viewers not to buy their products to encourage reuse, repair, and recycling of their products. As expected, this took the world by surprise, and it didn't end there.

They would later partner with eBay to create a marketplace to resell old Patagonia products - they actually created systems that would make it easy for people to buy less stuff!
