# Ecosia donates 80% of its profits to reforestation
Which organization can claim that they have planted a hundred million trees? Ecosia, a social enterprise and certified [B Corporation](https://www.bcorporation.net/), has planted 183 million trees as of Oct 10, 2023. How have they done this incredible feat? And where did they get the funds to do this?

The answer is in their innovative use of business to fund their mission. Ecosia is a search engine - kinda like Google or Yahoo, and they generate revenue when a user click on search ads. But since their mission for environmental stewardship is primary, not secondary, Ecosia donates 80% of its profits to planting trees!

They have built their own solar power station which powers 200% of what they need to run their servers. As you might expect, they are carbon negative, and each time you use the search engine, they *removes* 0.5 kg of CO2 from the environment. If they were as big as Google, could absorb 15% of all global CO2 emissions!
