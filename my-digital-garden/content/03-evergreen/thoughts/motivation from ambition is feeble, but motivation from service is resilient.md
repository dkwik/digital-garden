# Motivation from ambition is feeble, but motivation from service is resilient.

I've come to realize that my success in completing side-projects depended on one critical factor:

**Was the project in service to myself, or to others?**

I've gone through many side-projects through life. I've assembled my own computer. I've produced a full-length music album. I've started a side-hustle selling acoustic foam. I had phone cases stocked on Amazon's website. I created a professional film advertisement for a friend's business. I've produced a travel dance video. I had a song released on Spotify. I've organized prayer communities in school. 

Many were things I could hang my hat on, but many failed. 

For example, that phone case business? I spent a year designing them, negotiating prices from suppliers in China, working through supply chain issues, navigating Amazon's seller program, and finally got 200 cases up on the website. The result? I sold zero. Well, actually, I did sell one - but that was to my mom (thanks Mom!).

I've come to realize that the 'feeling' of working on some of those side-projects could be completely different, all depending simply on whether or not I was serving others through it.

When I was working to "make a name for myself", I was *really, really motivated*. I would obsess over an idea, but that eventually killed it. For example, when I was working on that phone case idea, I remember consistently being up at 2am, in my college computer lab, alone, hustling away. I was desperate. I had associated my identity in it. Eventually, I would burn out.

In contrast, for ideas that were rooted in service to others, it felt calm & steady. It felt like an act of service, and it brought me joy. Way more joy. I could find motivation for much, much longer because my cup was full, and I enjoyed giving my time. It felt more like hope-filled grit ([[hope-filled grit vs fear-based grit]])

So, not only is service good for the soul and beneficial to others, but it also makes a great tactical decision. Why not do it more?

Future thoughts:
-Service to others makes people want to help you.
-Choosing to serve others, makes you accountable to keeping promises.
-A life of service models after the intended design for human flourishing within the Christian worldview
