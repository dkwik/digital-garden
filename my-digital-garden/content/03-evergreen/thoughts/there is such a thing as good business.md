# There is such a thing as 'good' business

What comes to mind when you picture a business? Profit machines exploiting the vulnerable? Pompous people in pretty suits? Business doesn't typically come off as the most altruistic profession, but I believe it has the potential to be.

In fact, I already believe that [[there are extremely generous, humble people business people]], and that [[some of the toughest social issues might be best solved through business]]. 

There are great stories of how companies have done some counter-cultural things in pursuit of good business, such as how [[Chobani's committed to hiring refugees and giving 10 percent of their company to their employees]], or when [[Patagonia told it's customers not to buy their jackets]], or how [[Ecosia donates 80 percent of its profits to reforestation, planting over 180 million trees]]. 

Of course there is the poster child of social innovation, the social enterprise - a certain breed of business whose existence is entirely to serve a social end ([[social enterprises provides spare change for social change]]).

But good business doesn't only have to be explicitly humanitarian (though some of the best are), in fact, [[every aspect of a business can possess a redeeming quality.]], including products, branding, culture, operating model, and more.

Why is this so important anyway? This is important because [[we need good business to remain as good people]].
