# Embodied disciplines can ground your vision

Sometimes, creating embodied, physical rituals can help ground your vision. One example of this is Mr Rogers' philosophy of 143:

[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood](https://www.misterrogers.org/) was one of the most beloved kid's television program in America, that pushed back on the overstimulating, consumption-driven shows that were beginning to show up. The man behind the show was Fred Rogers, who was known for his radical kindness & unwavering vision to see every child feel safe, known, and valued. Mr Rogers shared his message with the world numerologically through the number 143: “It takes one letter to say I and four letters to say love and three letters to say you. One hundred and forty-three.”

But behind the pedagogical use of this symbol, was an extremely disciplined practice, and he took his philosophy of '143' to extreme levels. He was meticulous about his habits - what he ate, how he slept. He swam every day to keep fit, and all of this for an interesting goal: to weigh exactly 143 pounds at all times.

He maintained this weight for 30 years.

I wonder how much this discipline helped to keep him going during difficult moments. If he did not keep up this habit, would he have persevered as far as he did? Did this all-consuming practice enable him to, quite literally, 'embody' the practice of love? Enable him to love with a type of long obedience that far exceeds that of the average person? If so, it seems that creating embodied habits can be a useful tool to ground one's vision.
