# Every aspect of a business can possess a redeeming quality

When thinking about how [[there is such a thing as good business]], I tend to think about one-off, enormous philanthropic acts, or outward commitment to environmental stewardship. But it seems to me that the potential for good business can be more holistic than single acts of altruism.

Done right, all aspects of a business can have redemptive qualities:
## Products 
Products could be fashioned with an eye towards human-design, not just market opportunity. Thoughtful consideration could be made on whether the product *should* exist, and how it advances/impairs human flourishing.

## Brands 
Brands could advance virtuous narratives of the authentic human experience, not by the concealment or manipulation of truth. Campaigns based on insecurity-mongering, and status-idolization could be resolutely opposed.

## Culture 
The wellbeing of employees could be emphasized by the recognition of their whole personhood, rather than merely their usefulness as corporate assets. Roles can be designed to be profoundly meaningful - neither boring nor ultimate.

## Business Model
Business value can be measured holistically - not just by economic impact, but additionally by social and ecological impact. Allocation of profits are optimized generously across the whole organization rather than solely for owners or management.

### Future thought:
The above is a normative view ("what the world should be") powered by a Christian formulation of work, which means there is a gap between this 'ideal' and what is 'practical'. I wonder if organizations who practice this have a competitive advantage, or is this always a necessary sacrifice in pursuit of ethics? Put another way, does following the above generate virtuous cycles of business value?
