What do you picture when you picture a business? Do you see giant evil corporations filled with people in classic black suit, arms akimbo, always poised with the perfect head angle, as though they were constantly balancing a cup of water on their head, maniacally plotting how to best exploit the vulnerable for profit? Yeah I get it, business can seem pompous. But they don't have to be.

In fact, I think that some of [[the kindest, most humble people in the world are business people]], and some of the world's toughest problems are [best solved through business]. And there's a particular subset of businesses that I think are [incredible special] (more on that later)

You hear of the famous greats of the 'good business' movement and how they have done some counter-cultural things in pursuit of good business, such as how [[Chobani's committed to hiring refugees and giving 10% of their company to their employees]], or when [Patagonia told it's customers not to buy their jackets], or how [Ecosia donated 80% of its profits to reforestation, planting over 120 million trees]. 

Granted these are huge corporations with tons of resources. But what about the majority of other smaller businesses [that are credited for 63% of jobs from 1995 to 2021](https://www.uschamber.com/small-business/state-of-small-business-now)? Well this happens too.

And there's a certain breed of business that I've not even started on who  social enterprises and poverty alleviation through microlending.
