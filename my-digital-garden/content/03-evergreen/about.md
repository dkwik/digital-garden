# Welcome

Hello my name is Daniel Kwik and welcome to my canvas where I think with the 'garage door open'. 

This is where I do habitual, informal, thinking with no fixed agenda, or end-goal. These thoughts are designed to be:

1. **Intentionally Unpolished.** Here, you will not find academic writing, but concise and densely linked ideas. I sacrifice precision for discovery, choosing to explore rather than to educate.
2. **Domain Agnostic**. I tend to have a LOT of interests, so instead of focusing on one broad topic, I'll make broad *connections* between diverse domains, in pursuit of lateral thinking.
3. **Non-Prescriptive**. Each thought reflects one muse at one moment in my life. You may have different thoughts (on faith, for example). That's okay. I may have different thoughts now. Reach out and let's refine them together.

So. If you are okay with the above, take a journey of exploration with me. Come further up, come further in.
## Entry Points
Currently, I am writing about the intersection of business, social impact, and a bunch of random things  ðŸ™‚

- [[there is such a thing as good business]].
- Social impact requires people with [[idealistic pragmatism]].
- [[culture is shaped not only through ideas, but through things]].
- [[Sabbath is a gift, but it takes 'sacrifice']].
