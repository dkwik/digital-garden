# Welcome

Hello my name is Daniel Kwik and welcome to my canvas where I think with the 'garage door open'. 

This is where I do habitual, informal thinking with no fixed agenda, or end-goal. They are designed to be:

1. **Intentionally Unpolished.** Here, you will not find academic writing, but concise and densely-linked ideas. I sacrifice precision for discovery.
2. **Domain Agnostic**. I tend to have a lot of interests, so instead of focusing on one broad topic, I'll make broad *connections* between domains, in pursuit of lateral thinking.
3. **Non-Prescriptive**. Each thought reflects one muse at one moment in my life. You may have different thoughts (on faith, for example). That's great - reach out and let's refine our thinking together.

So. I invite you to take a journey of exploration with me. Come further up & further in!

## New Musings
Here are some new top-of-mind thoughts.
- [[AI might force the convergence of our world's language]]
- [[embodied disciplines can ground your vision]]
-  [[the step-ladder of life - a framework for life]]
- [[Good storytelling is a product of good self-awareness]]
## Entry Points
Here are some older and more connected thoughts.
- [[there is such a thing as good business]].
- [[culture is shaped not only through ideas, but through things]].
- Social impact requires people with [[idealistic pragmatism]].
- [[hope-filled grit vs fear-based grit]].
- [[3 types of work - creating, cultivating, completing]].
- [[there can be sacredness in dull, monotonous moments]].
- [[sabbath is a gift, but it takes sacrifice]].
- [[motivation from ambition is feeble, but motivation from service is resilient]]

## Short Stories
Here are some personal short stories that have taught me something, or helped me come to a unique realization.

- [[My experience with the accelerometer of life in different cities.]]
- [[how an indecision about tea helped me reflect about my life path]]
