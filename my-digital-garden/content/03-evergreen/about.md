# Welcome

Hello my name is Daniel Kwik and welcome to my canvas where I think with the 'garage door open'. 

This is my first attempt at sharing my thoughts with the world, and i'm glad you are here. These thoughts are intentionally unpolished, and I invite you to help me refine them. If you are looking for academic, publishable writing, this is unfortunately not the right avenue. But if you'd like to take a journey of exploration with me, come sail with me!

Currently, I am writing about the intersection of business, social impact, and being purpose-driven.
## Top of mind

- [[Business is not only for money-hungry, greedy people]]?
- Social impact requires people with [[idealistic pragmatism]].
- [[Sabbath is a gift, but it takes 'sacrifice']]
