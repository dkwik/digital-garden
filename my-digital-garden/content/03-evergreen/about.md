# Welcome

Hello my name is Daniel Kwik and welcome to my canvas where I think with the 'garage door open'. 

This is where I do what I like to call 'habitual informal research' with no fixed agenda, or end-goal. These thoughts are intentionally unpolished, and I invite you to help me refine them. If you are looking for academic, publishable writing, this is unfortunately not the right avenue. But if you'd like to take a journey of exploration with me, come jump in!

Currently, I am writing about the intersection of business, social impact, and a bunch of random things  ðŸ™‚
## Entry Points

- [[there is such a thing as good business]].
- Social impact requires people with [[idealistic pragmatism]].
- [[culture is shaped not only through ideas, but through things]].
