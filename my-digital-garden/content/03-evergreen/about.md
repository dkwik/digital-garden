# Welcome

Hello my name is Daniel Kwik and welcome to my canvas where I think with the 'garage door open'. 

This is where I do habitual, informal thinking with no fixed agenda, or end-goal. They are designed to be:

1. **Intentionally Unpolished.** Here, you will not find academic writing, but concise and densely-linked ideas. I sacrifice precision for discovery.
2. **Domain Agnostic**. I tend to have a lot of interests, so instead of focusing on one broad topic, I'll make broad *connections* between domains, in pursuit of lateral thinking.
3. **Non-Prescriptive**. Each thought reflects one muse at one moment in my life. You may have different thoughts (on faith, for example). That's okay. I may have different thoughts now. Reach out and let's refine them together.

So. I invite you to take a journey of exploration with me. Come further up & further in!
## Entry Points
Currently, I am writing about the intersection of business, social impact, and some personal development  ðŸ™‚

- [[there is such a thing as good business]].
- [[culture is shaped not only through ideas, but through things]].
- Social impact requires people with [[idealistic pragmatism]].
- [[sabbath is a gift, but it takes 'sacrifice']].
- [[hope-filled grit vs fear-based grit]].
- [[3 types of work - creating, cultivating, completing]].
- [[there can be sacredness in dull, monotonous habits]].
- [[motivation from ambition is feeble, motivation from service is resilient]]

## Short Stories
Here are some personal short stories that have taught me something, or help me come to a unique realization.

- [[My experience with the accelerometer of life in different cities.]]
