1s - great depth, great effort to maintain friendship.
2s, 3s - don't reap the communal benefits of being in a group.
4s - really nice and everyone still feels known individually, but lacking communal feel slightly.
5s - perfect
6s - individuality gets lost, too many conversations, not everyone can share, but nice communal feel
7s - too many people, all individuality is lost, no gain in communal feel.
