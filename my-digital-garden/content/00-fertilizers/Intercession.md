-If you love someone, and you want more from them than you can personally give, it will move you to intercession. It will move you beyond your ability into the heart and power of God to ask him to act on behalf of others.
-If I don't find myself praying for others, it is because I either: don't love people enough to be compassionately moved to intercede, or I don't believe in the power of God to act.
