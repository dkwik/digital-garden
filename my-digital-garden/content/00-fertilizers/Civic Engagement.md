Liberals and conservatives both make individual freedom and personal happiness the ultimate value, rather than the common good.

Liberals individualism see differing beliefs in abortion, sex, and other social issues as an attack on rights and personal freedom, while Conservatives' individualism is found in their distrust of the public sector, and social issues as a result of person irresponsibility.
