I wish that Christianity had a better reputation in the world today. It seems like the prevailing cultural stance among my generation is that Christianity is an ancient form of escapism that is now obsolete post-enlightenment, and that it's Christians are antiquated people trying to 'reverse the clock' to a less enlightened time. At best, people seem to tolerate it's continued presence as long as it is confined to the private life, but oppose it's presence in the public square.

And when they see the Christian mission, they may think of a military conquest, or the colonization of indigenous people groups. The word mission is full of baggage. 

But aren't we all 'on mission'? Don't we all recognize that the world is broken? and are finding our place to 'make it a better place'? Don't we all bear the responsibility of evangelizing what we believe to be good, right, and proper for human flourishing? 

There is an impasse between doubt and belief. It won't be solved through brute-force idea "conquest", neither will it be solved through pluralistic denial that differing beliefs don't matter.

Self-examination.
