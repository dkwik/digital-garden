# we need business to be good

Why is it important that [[there is such a thing as good business]]? Isn't business in itself sufficient for the economy and job creation? As long as businesses meet their economic function while adhering to a baseline of ethics, why push any further?

The answer is that I think we can underestimate the influence business has on culture, and thereby who we are as people. While we tend to think that culture comes from the ideas we collectively choose to believe in, in actuality, [[culture is shaped not only through ideas, but through things]]. If this is true, business really is an *engine* for cultural production, one that has the ability to scale massively and at an incredibly pace, that disrupts our personal lives (just take a look at how [ChatGPT reached 100 million people in two months](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/chatgpt-sets-record-for-fastest-growing-user-base-in-history-report-says/)). 

Thus, it is paramount that we create the right businesses that unlocks the right cultural possibilities - ones that are restorative rather than destructive.
