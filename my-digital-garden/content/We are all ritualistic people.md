The word 'ritual' is rarely used in modernity - it has this traditional connotation, that is associated almost exclusively to religious practices.

But we are all 'ritualistic' - I wake up at a 6.45am, have a particular type of coffee (medium roasted beans with an aeropress), make my bed ([[making my bed is my most important morning habit]]), and have breakfast each day before work.

We are ritualistic because our brains need it to function day-to-day. Psychologists have uncovered that we have 2 modes of thought -  System 2 thinking, which is slow, deliberate, and logical - used for higher order thinking tasks, and System 1 thinking, which is fast, instinctive, and emotional. ([See Daniel Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow](https://a.co/d/c9Ogvep)). 

System 1 thinking is our ritualistic brain. We need it to quicken our thinking - which is good if we are met with a truck hurling down towards us and we need to think, but makes us susceptible with doomscrolling on Tiktok.

Why is it important to be reflective about this? Our rituals shape us into who we are. We often think we are 'thinking things', but we are really actually creatures of habit. [[Our hearts are shaped less by how we think, but what we do]].
