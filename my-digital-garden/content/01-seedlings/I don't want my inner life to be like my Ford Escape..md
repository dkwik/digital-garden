My first car that I got in college was a 2012 Black Ford Escape - it's shiny, the deep black gives it a polished, modern look, and when I gave rides to my friends for the first time, they almost always commented, "wow that's such a sleek car" - that was, until they entered inside. In contrast to the flashy exterior, inside was a dull beige - kinda like the color of the pages of a book that was neither new nor old. It didn't have the fresh white pages of a new book, nor the antiquated deep yellow of aged books. It was kinda yucky. The deepest form of color in the carseat was a brown splatter where a friend spilled chocolate ice cream a few years back. I don't want my life to be like that. A polished exterior doesn't make up for a messy interior, and I've found myself too often being concerned with my exterior image rather than allowing others into my inner life. So here we go - in pursuit of learning how to share the truest parts of me, I'm welcoming others into my inner life.
