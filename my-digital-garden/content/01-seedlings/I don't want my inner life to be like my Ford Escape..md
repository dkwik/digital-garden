My first car that I got in college was a 2012 Black Ford Escape - it's shiny, the deep black gives it a polished, modern look, and when I gave rides to my friends for the first time, they almost always commented, "wow that's such a sleek car" - that was, until they entered inside. Inside was a dull beige - kinda like the color of the pages of a book that was neither new nor old. It lacked the freshness of white pages of a new book, nor the deep brown of antiquated books. Kinda yucky. The deepest saturation of color in the carseat was a brown splatter where a friend spilled chocolate ice cream a few years back. 

I don't want my life to be like my Ford Escape. Better to kill the bacteria out in the open sun than let mold grow behind the facade of a polished exterior. I've found myself too concerned about my exterior image rather than my inner life. Writing with the garage door open helps me to create the right formational habits. Air out the dirty laundry.
