_Sicinius: What is the city but the people?_
_Citizens: True, the people are the city._
*Shakespeare, William. Coriolanus. Act 3 Scene 1.*

Cities are like organisms. There exists a  'metabolism' of a city.

Why cities are resilient, but businesses are not.

Garden Cities
	- Garden Cities of To-morrow (Howard Ebenezer)
	- Singapore's design
		- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w3QCcItxTo
		- Legislation that enforces every building to replace a 100% of the green space it took up into the building itself.
		- 80% of Singaporeans live in public housing estates.
		- 3rd most densely populated country, island, so there's not opportunity to for sprawl. In order to preserve ecological balance, the garden needed to be built upwards.
		- Garden City > City in a Garden > City in Nature
		- Punggol water ways - took 2 dammed reservoirs, and connected the water ways. Instead of connecting by pipe, they created a river, making it the 'Venice' of Singapore.


What is to love about Singapore's urban planning?
	-Within 5 years, the Housing Development Board (HDB) built 51,000 flats.
	-It's only half the size of metropolitan London, but Singapore is a country
